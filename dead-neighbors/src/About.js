        <h3>About Dead Neighbors</h3>
        <p>
          The mission of Dead Neighbors is to help show you that the numbers you
          see on the screen actually represent your children, mothers, fathers,
          grandparents, friends and neighbors.
        </p>
        <p>
          In todays day and age, it is so easy to move on to the next thing very
          quickly. There is so much information out in the world and it
          distracts us from the fact that people are sick, suffering, and dying.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please take a moment to let the numbers soak in and feel the struggle
          and loss in your neighbors hearts.
